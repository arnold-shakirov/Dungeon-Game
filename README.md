# Dungeon Game

## Overview
This project is a text-based adventure game where the player explores various rooms, collects items, and interacts with the environment. The game is built using Java and focuses on core object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation.

## Features
- **Player and Room Interaction**: Players can explore different rooms, pick up items, and move between areas.
- **Inventory Management**: Players can collect and manage items throughout their journey.
- **Game Map**: A structure that defines how the rooms are connected, allowing for non-linear exploration.

## Classes
The project consists of several core Java classes that structure the game:

- **`GameMap`**: Handles the creation of the game’s map, including the rooms and their connections.
- **`Item`**: Represents the various items a player can collect and use.
- **`Player`**: Defines the player’s attributes, such as inventory and movement.
- **`Room`**: Represents each room in the game, including the items it contains and the rooms it connects to.
- **`Main`**: The entry point of the game, where the game loop and player interactions are handled.

## Requirements
- **Java 8** or higher.
- No additional libraries are required.

## Installation
To install and play the game:

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Compile the Java files using a Java compiler.
3. Run the `Main` class.
